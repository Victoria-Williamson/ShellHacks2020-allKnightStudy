#Currenntly A work in progress !! ( Hopefully will be completed within the first two weeks of October 2020)

The goal of this application is to create a new web application that can give users a temporary study buddy to safely make new friends over quarantine. This applicaiton is not fully funcitoning yet, but will hopefully be done soon. Currently we are working on creating a sign in process and way of connecting study buddies with each other through their accounts. Once an account is created the studybuddies will be able to connet with other people and via. video chat and chat box. 

Once the initial application is completed some features we hope to add in the future, are the abillity to use the application for features other than studying such as making an Among Us, Fall Guys, and more video chat room that connets you to other people playing the game. So, you can play in voice lobbies and here each other to make the video game process less lonely. Also, we plan on adding a feature similar to Netflix Party that connects you to groups who are interested in watching similar movies and a chat room connected to that for you to chat throughout the movie.

Security and Safeness wise we plan on making the application safe by only allowing students at universities or communnitty colleges able to make an account. This is done so if anyone is reported for harassing or innapporiate activety their negative actions can be reporting back and handled by their university's code of conduct.

With quarantine leaving many forced to stay at home during University and without friends we hope this application will be able to fix that. Also, although quarantine will hopefully end soon we hope this application will still be able to create a safe and fun way for students at a University to connect.
